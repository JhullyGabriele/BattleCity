# BattleCity
A game inspired by Battle City.Prompt/Terminal version.

Development of a game where the objective is to defend a base against enemy tanks, including the implementation of shooting mechanics with animations. The enemy behavior is automated through programmed movement and attack patterns, demonstrating skills in programming logic, interactive mechanics development, and real-time event control.

Game created in collaboration with Lucas Lessa Duarte for a class at UFPEL.

To start the game, make sure you have the JDK installed. Type javac *.java in the terminal to compile it, and then type java Main.

Graphic version still under construction.
